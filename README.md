# Awesome LWC

### UPDATE!!!

---

I just made this to a LWC OSS site [here](https://www.awesomelwc.com/)!

I plan on making a style/contribution guide to the site ASAP. Site is fairly basic right now, some elbow grease and SLDS based on the OSS Trailhead.

All this is community driven and isn't directly associated to Salesforce or related organizations.

A list AND SITE of interesting Lightning Web Components resources and code examples

Most of this repo is for "On platform" means resources specific to the SFDC platform, but [LWC Open Source](https://lwc.dev/) items are included as well.

Feel free to Fork, PR, and contribute to this list. For JS Library suggestions, try to suggest why it's a useful tool for the SFDC Landscape.
