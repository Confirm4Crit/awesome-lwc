# Awesome LWC

A list of interesting on platform Lightning Web Components resources and code examples

"On platform" means resources specific to the SFDC platform, and not necessarily [LWC Open Source](https://lwc.dev/).

Feel free to Fork, PR, and contribute to this list. For JS Library suggestions, try to suggest why it's a useful tool for the SFDC Landscape.
